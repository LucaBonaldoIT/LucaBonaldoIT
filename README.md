I love creating and managing complex systems. I was born in Italy in 2003, and since a very young age, I have been in love with technology. I find happiness in every problem I manage to solve, every solution I optimize, and every person I help. Every day, I strive to learn as much as possible to improve both myself and the software I provide.
